struct Student{
//fields
}


struct vs Union

create an employee union
	-Empid
	-EMployeename
	-gender
	-salary
-get employee data
-print employee data


DATA STRUCTURE
	-Insertion
	-Deletion
	-Searching
	-Sorting
	
Why??
	-Efficent data management
	-Optimized performance
	-better memory management
	-Faciliate Complex problems
	
	
	Linear Data structure
	-Array=> fixed collection of elements of the same type
	-Linked List==> a dyamic collection of nodes linked via pointers
	-Stack==> Elements are added and removed from the top(LIFO)
	-Queue==> Elements are added and removed from the front(FIFO)
	-Dequeue(Double-ENded Queue)==>Elements are added and removed from both sides
	
	Non-Linear Data structure(Store in a hierarical or interconnected way)
	-Tree==> Hierarical structure with a root and child nodes
	-Graph==> COllection of nodes connected by edges
	
	Why Use data structures in C==>
	1.Low-level memory conrtrol==> 
	2.used in system programming/os development
	3.High performance

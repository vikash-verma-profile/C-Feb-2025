struct Student{
//fields
}


struct vs Union

create an employee union
	-Empid
	-EMployeename
	-gender
	-salary
-get employee data
-print employee data


DATA STRUCTURE
	-Insertion
	-Deletion
	-Searching
	-Sorting
	
Why??
	-Efficent data management
	-Optimized performance
	-better memory management
	-Faciliate Complex problems
	
	
	Linear Data structure
	-Array=> fixed collection of elements of the same type
	-Linked List==> a dyamic collection of nodes linked via pointers
	-Stack==> Elements are added and removed from the top(LIFO)
	-Queue==> Elements are added and removed from the front(FIFO)
	-Dequeue(Double-ENded Queue)==>Elements are added and removed from both sides
	
	Non-Linear Data structure(Store in a hierarical or interconnected way)
	-Tree==> Hierarical structure with a root and child nodes
	-Graph==> COllection of nodes connected by edges
	
	Why Use data structures in C==>
	1.Low-level memory conrtrol==> 
	2.used in system programming/os development
	3.High performance
	
	
	STL
	
	Standard Template Library
	1.Containers==>Container are the data stuructures used to store objects
		1.Sequence Containers
			-Arrays==> non-resizable
			-Vectors==> Dynamic sized array
			-Dequeue==> double ended queue. Expension and contraction
			-Lists==>  (Doubly linked list)List container store data in non-contiguous memory unike vectors
			-Forward Lists==> single link list
		2.Container Adaptors
			-Stack==>
			-Queue
			-Priority queue
		3.Associative Conatiners==> elements are stored in sorted order
			-Sets
			-Maps
			-Multisets
			-Multimaps
		4.UnOrdered Associative COnatiners
			-UnOrdered Sets
			-UnOrdered Maps
			-UnOrdered Multisets
			-UnOrdered Multimaps
		
	2.Alogorithms
		-Manipultive Alogorithms
			-copy
			-fill
			-transform
			-remove
		-non manipulating Alogorithms
			-max_element
			-find
			-count
			-is_sorted
	3.Itearators
		-input => used to read values from a suquence once and only move forward
		-output=> used to write values into a sequence once and only move forward
		-Forward=> Combitnation of input +output
		-Bidirectional=> forward and backward
		-Random access=> in addition give a random access to an elements
	4.Functors
		-Airthmatic
		-Relational Functors
		-Logical 
		-Bitwise Functors
	
	
	
	list<int>==> create a struct employye/student
	
	abcdfasdas
	
	a=>
	b=>
	c=>
